# UltraLove Shopify app

Separate web interface for the existing **UltraLove Dropshipping Lab** app,
scaffolded from Shopify's MIT-licensed React Router template. The upstream
license remains in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

## Status

Development foundation only, not a deployed product picker. The authenticated
home screen is read-only and accepts only
`ultralove-integration-lab.myshopify.com`. Shopify authentication and signed
webhook verification use the official SDK. Lab-store checks additionally apply
to login, authenticated routes and webhook handlers. The template's product
creation demo has been removed.

Catalog browsing, selection persistence, pricing, import jobs and ongoing
inventory synchronization are the next implementation steps. The existing
feed and root-only PHP workers remain in `craigpestell/ultralove`; this web
process must never run those workers as root or read their credential files.
No orders, payments, emails, shipments or storefront publication are enabled.

## Local validation

Use Node 24 and npm:

```sh
npm ci
export DATABASE_URL=file:dev.sqlite
npm run prisma -- generate
npm run check
```

Checks include offline lab-policy tests, TypeScript, ESLint and the production
build. These do not establish live Shopify authentication or feed connectivity.
For a configured local session database, run `npm run setup`.

Unused GraphQL demo/code-generation dependencies are omitted. Prisma's config
dependency uses a scoped `deepmerge-ts` 8 override for its recursion advisory;
Prisma generation, schema validation and migrations must pass with that override.

### Verification recorded, 2026-10-09

- Four offline policy tests passed; type-check, lint and production build passed.
- Prisma generation, schema validation and SQLite migrations passed.
- `npm audit` reported zero vulnerabilities, including development dependencies.
- The production build served its landing page over local HTTP with dummy
  credentials. Foreign-store app/login requests returned 403, duplicate shop
  parameters returned 400, and an invalid-signature webhook returned 401.
- Live Shopify session authentication, embedded rendering, hosted feed access
  and imports remain unverified. No installed app settings were changed.

## Existing Shopify app

Verified in the Dev Dashboard on 2026-10-09:

- Organization: `239653376`; app: `433204330497`.
- Active version: `ultralove-dropshipping-lab-2`.
- Current URL: `https://ultralove-lab.104-248-211-144.sslip.io`.
- Current embedding setting: `false`.
- API version: `2026-10`.
- Existing scopes are retained in the unlinked `shopify.app.toml`.

This repository does **not** create another Shopify app. The empty client ID
intentionally prevents treating the template as a linked/deployable app.
Use Shopify CLI to link to the existing app after the hosting/authentication
design is verified; never select creation of a new app. Do not run `app dev`
with automatic URL updates or deploy a configuration over the installed app
without reviewing the resulting configuration and preserving its current
permissions and client-credentials worker access.

Copy `.env.example` to an untracked `.env` and provision the existing app's key,
secret and approved HTTPS URL securely. Do not use a manager's feed password,
commit credentials, print `shopify app env show`, or expose them to the browser.

## Hosting and activation gate

Recommended first host: the existing isolated DigitalOcean integration-lab
droplet, under a separate non-root service and app directory, not inside
WordPress. No new hosting purchase is needed for that choice; its current
capacity still needs checking. This app can move to another Node/container host.

Before switching the installed app to this interface:

1. Confirm host capacity, persistent session storage, backups and an isolated
   service account. Keep session data and app credentials outside the webroot;
   persist the SQLite database across deploys. The Docker image includes the
   Prisma CLI for migrations; it is not a complete deployment configuration.
   Set `DATABASE_URL` to an absolute SQLite file on the protected persistent
   volume, not the example's relative development path.
2. Establish HTTPS and reverse proxying with no HTML/session CDN caching.
   Shopify must be able to embed the interface; do not put an interactive
   Cloudflare Access login in its iframe or weaken protection on the dev feed.
3. Validate the official SDK authentication flow for this own-organization app,
   its redirect URLs, signed webhooks and iframe headers. Session-token/OAuth
   authentication for the UI is distinct from the existing worker's
   client-credentials grant; worker success does not prove UI authentication.
4. Arrange a dedicated server-side catalog credential and approved HTTPS feed
   access from this host. Do not expose feed credentials or bypass dev's Access
   policy. Do not copy the root-only importer behind a public HTTP endpoint.
5. Test login from Shopify and rejection of other shops. Preserve the existing
   worker and verify it after publishing a reviewed app version with the new
   URL and embedding enabled.

Until those checks pass, the installed app version and existing worker remain
unchanged. Production rollout and independent retailer onboarding require
separate work and approval.
